# 3D Animated Duel Monsters

The purpose of this particular repository is to store all the animated models of duel monsters played in the Yu-Gi-Oh TCG and OCG. 

As this initiative is an open source project, so we are relying on you to build and maintain this repository. If you can prove to all of us that you can build quality duel monster models; you will be allowed to contribute. 

Remember that your work will eventually appear at official tournaments. I cannot stress how important it is that you do an excellent job.
